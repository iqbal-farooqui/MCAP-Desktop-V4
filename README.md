To make a new release version, first make sure you increment the `package.version` property in tauri.conf.json. Commit (do not push) that change and assign it a tag with that version, use `s` as a prefix for staging and `p` as a prefix for production e.g. s1.0.7 or p1.0.0. After the tag is assigned, now push your change. The build will run automatically and will create release artifacts with their signatures. In the Releases section, publish the latest one. The API will parse them whenever the client checks for updates.
